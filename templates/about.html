            Based in Mumbai, India, Little Lemon is a family owned
            Mediterranean restaurant, focused on simple italian recipes served with a
            modern twist.
          </p>
          <p>
            The chefs draw inspiration from Indian, Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture
            and have a menu of 12-15 items that they rotate seasonally.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate
            prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.

            Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who
            moved to India to pursue their shared dream of owning a
            restaurant.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience
            as a chef in Italy.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to
            expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional
            cuisines from the mediterranean region.
